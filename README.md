# World Happiness Index Analysis - Liberia, Ukraine, Congo

## üìä Project Overview

In this project, we analyze the **World Happiness Report** data for three countries: **Liberia, Ukraine, and Congo**. The goal is to understand how various socio-economic factors contribute to the happiness scores of these countries, and perform statistical and regression analysis to interpret the results.

The World Happiness Report is based on survey data where respondents evaluate their current life situations on a scale of 0 to 10 (Cantril ladder). The happiness score is derived from this evaluation and decomposed into several contributing factors.
